# About this project

This is a simple implementation of a game using concepts very similar to [Bingo](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingo). There are a couple of themes available in the game to get you started. All the themes lives under [theme-card.ts file](https://github.com/nishahs08/bingo/blob/main/src/components/GamePage/theme-cards.ts). You can submit more themes if you'd like to by simply raising a PR to `main`.

# Further ideas

- [ ] Make this game multiplayer, using socket.io
- [ ] Simplify the processing of adding themes to the game, maybe by providing a backend to save / modify themes
- [ ] Allow users to modify the appearance of the board
